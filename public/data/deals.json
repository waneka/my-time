It is a system which combines assisted yoga therapy, rhythmic massage, acupressure, gentle twisting, and energy work.  This work aids in releasing stress and tension, increases vitality and well-being, and deepens the connection between mind, body and spirit in both the giver and receiver. Combining Thai massage with your own meditation makes this system complete, balanced and deeply therapeutic.

I have so much gratitude for the positive responses I get from clients, and how well my practice is growing and changing.\r\n\r\nI live in a creative live-work space in the Arts District of downtown LA, and share the loft with my circus performer friends. I have an extensive history in performance, physical, vocal, and visual arts, and exercise these talents regularly along with my massage practice.  \r\n\r\nMy experience in gymnastics and power tumbling helps me to understand the bodies and stresses of very active people.\r\n\r\nI am originally from Nebraska and go back home to see my family at least once every year during the holidays.
